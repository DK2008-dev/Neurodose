Next Steps Action Plan - Post Performance Gap Analysis

Based on comprehensive evaluation results and literature analysis,
this script provides a clear roadmap for advancing the research.

Key Findings Summary:
- Traditional ML: 51.1% ± 8.4% (essentially random baseline)
- Literature claims: 87-91% (data augmentation + different validation)
- Our methodology: LOPOCV = clinically realistic, no data leakage
- Critical insight: Need deep learning or advanced feature engineering

  - Random Forest evaluation: 35.2% ± 5.3% (comprehensive)
  - Data leakage identification and correction
  - Literature methodology analysis (Al-Nafjan et al., MDPI 2025)
  - Performance gap explanation: Data augmentation vs. clinical reality

❗ KEY INSIGHT DISCOVERED:
  - Literature baseline (before augmentation): 62% pain detection, 46% severity
