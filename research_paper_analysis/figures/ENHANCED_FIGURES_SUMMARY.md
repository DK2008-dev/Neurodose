- **Panel B**: Inflation sources pie chart (CV leakage, augmentation illusion, etc.)
- **Panel C**: Augmentation performance decay with validation rigor
- **Panel D**: Method complexity vs claims showing inverse reality relationship

**Key Discovery**: Augmentation illusion contributes 10-20% to literature inflation.

### 6. Feature Importance Enhanced (feature_importance_enhanced.png)
**4-panel feature analysis:**

## Impact Assessment

These enhanced figures provide:
1. **Stronger Visual Evidence** for the complexity paradox across multiple dimensions
2. **First Quantitative Analysis** of the augmentation illusion (79-97% inflation)
3. **Comprehensive Individual Differences** visualization showing 18.5% heterogeneity
