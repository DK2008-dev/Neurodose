### 1. The Complexity Paradox in EEG Pain Classification (2024)
**Objective:** Comprehensive evaluation of simple vs. advanced computational methods for EEG-based pain detection  
**Key Findings:**
- Discovery of multi-dimensional complexity paradox where simple methods outperform sophisticated approaches
- Identification of "augmentation illusion" - systematic bias in EEG research methodology
- Demonstration of ternary classification failure across all tested methods
- Quantification of 35-39% literature-reality performance gap
